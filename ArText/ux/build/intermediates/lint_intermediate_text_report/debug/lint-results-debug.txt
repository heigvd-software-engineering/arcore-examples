/Users/james/Documents/Avalia-HEIG/Projets/sceneform-android/ux/build.gradle:45: Warning: A newer version of androidx.annotation:annotation than 1.3.0 is available: 1.4.0 [GradleDependency]
    implementation "androidx.annotation:annotation:$annotation_version"
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/Users/james/Documents/Avalia-HEIG/Projets/sceneform-android/ux/build.gradle:46: Warning: A newer version of androidx.appcompat:appcompat than 1.4.1 is available: 1.4.2 [GradleDependency]
    implementation "androidx.appcompat:appcompat:$appcompat_version"
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/Users/james/Documents/Avalia-HEIG/Projets/sceneform-android/ux/src/main/java/com/google/ar/sceneform/ux/BaseArFragment.java:193: Warning: Unnecessary; SDK_INT is never < 24 [ObsoleteSdkInt]
        if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < VERSION_CODES.N) {
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLocation":
   The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such
   as shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to drawable-mdpi and
   consider providing higher and lower resolution versions in drawable-ldpi,
   drawable-hdpi and drawable-xhdpi. If the icon really is density independent
   (for example a solid color) you can place it in drawable-nodpi.

/Users/james/Documents/Avalia-HEIG/Projets/sceneform-android/ux/src/main/res/layout/sceneform_instructions_augmented_image.xml:1: Warning: Missing contentDescription attribute on image [ContentDescription]
<ImageView
 ~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ContentDescription":
   Non-textual widgets like ImageViews and ImageButtons should use the
   contentDescription attribute to specify a textual description of the widget
   such that screen readers and other accessibility tools can adequately
   describe the user interface.

   Note that elements in application screens that are purely decorative and do
   not provide any content or enable a user action should not have
   accessibility content descriptions. In this case, just suppress the lint
   warning with a tools:ignore="ContentDescription" attribute.

   Note that for text fields, you should not set both the hint and the
   contentDescription attributes since the hint will never be shown. Just set
   the hint.
