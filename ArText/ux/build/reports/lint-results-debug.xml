        explanation="This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."

        category="Performance"
        priority="6"
        summary="Obsolete SDK_INT Version Check"
        explanation="This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the `minSdkVersion` (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high as the version checked for.&#xA;&#xA;Similarly, it also looks for resources in `-vNN` folders, such as `values-v14` where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the `minSdkVersion`, where the contents should be merged into the best folder."

        severity="Warning"
        message="Found bitmap drawable `res/drawable/sceneform_hand_phone.png` in densityless folder"
        category="Usability:Icons"
        priority="5"
        summary="Image defined in density-independent drawable folder"
        explanation="The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such as shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to `drawable-mdpi` and consider providing higher and lower resolution versions in `drawable-ldpi`, `drawable-hdpi` and `drawable-xhdpi`. If the icon **really** is density independent (for example a solid color) you can place it in `drawable-nodpi`."

        message="Missing `contentDescription` attribute on image"
        category="Accessibility"
        priority="3"
        summary="Image without `contentDescription`"
        explanation="Non-textual widgets like ImageViews and ImageButtons should use the `contentDescription` attribute to specify a textual description of the widget such that screen readers and other accessibility tools can adequately describe the user interface.&#xA;&#xA;Note that elements in application screens that are purely decorative and do not provide any content or enable a user action should not have accessibility content descriptions. In this case, just suppress the lint warning with a tools:ignore=&quot;ContentDescription&quot; attribute.&#xA;&#xA;Note that for text fields, you should not set both the `hint` and the `contentDescription` attributes since the hint will never be shown. Just set the `hint`."
